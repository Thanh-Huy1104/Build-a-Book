        <p className="About--p1">Our inspiration for Build-a-Book begins with the desire to converge education, storytelling, and creativity. Drawing influence from the heartfelt moments we’ve experienced with our parents as children, we opted to create software that would reduce the gap between technology and human emotion. We believe education and imagination should strongly intertwine, to make learning a creative journey for both kids and their parents. Build-A-Book’s objective is to continue to foster loving moments amongst family, in a world of digital proficiency.</p>
        <p className="About--p2">Build-A-Book is to be used as an educational platform, putting the creative process in the hands of parents. Starting with a simple and brief prompt, our software can craft a personalized and immersive story for children. Parents will have an original tale to tell, paired with a digital book, full of unique and animated images. Build-a-Book blends education and creativity, transforming learning into a comprehensive experience for both parents and children.</p>
