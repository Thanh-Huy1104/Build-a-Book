<h3>Why We Built It</h3>
<p>
  This project was built in <b>24 hours</b> for the <b>ConUHacks VIII</b> Hackathon based in Montreal, Canada. Inspired by the profound impact of <b>heartfelt moments</b> shared with parents during childhood, our team sought the desire to converge education and technology in order to make these moments more <b>accessible</b>, <b>interactive</b> and <b>sustainable</b>. 
<h3>How We Built it</h3>
<p>
  With the help of the innovative capabilities of <b>Stability AI</b> and <b>Open AI</b>, our team was able to generate personalized, multi-sentence stories from a basic prompt, forming the core of Build-A-Book's unique offering. For the generation of stories, <b>python</b> and <b>flask</b> were used to work with Stability and Open AI api's, seamlessly converting the user's simple prompt into an entire children's book. The integration of these images, along with the entire user-interface was achieved using <b>React</b>, along with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. Thanks to our <b>exceptional UI design</b> and <b>creative use of AI</b>, Build-A-Book was <b>awarded</b> with the <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/build-a-book">Best Use of AI in Education</a> at ConUHacks VIII!
